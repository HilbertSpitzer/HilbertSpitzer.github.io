<font color="red">Anime are Japanese cartoons, manga are Japanese comics</font><br/><br/>

"The Japanese comic-book industry, which dominates 80% of the worldwide market"<a href="Anime.html#1">[1]</a><br/><br/>

"Japanese anime has held the number-one position in the world of animation for nearly two decades. Over 60% of the animated cartoons broadcast around the world are made in Japan"<a href="Anime.html#2">[2]</a><br/><br/>

"Over the past 25 years Japanese anime and manga have taken hold in China. At least 500 million anime comic consumers currently live in China, fueeling a market worth RMB 100 billion each year (Yang, 2008), or $14.6 billion.
Japanese anime dominated a recent cartoon search entry ranking by Baidu, China's No. 1 search engine....and among the top 20 entries, only two non-Japanese products("Tom and Jerry" from the United States and "Lotus Lantern" from China, ranking 12th and 20th, respectively) managed to enter the list"<a href="Anime.html#3">[3]</a><br/><br/>

According to the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) in 2007, the US anime industry alone was worth $4.35 billion<br/><br/>

According to the Association of Japanese Animations, 60 member anime production companies now provide products in 112 countries, reaching some 87.2 percent of the world's population.
Sakurai said many Japanese probably are not aware just how popular anime is overseas.
"Many young people in other countries grow up with Japan's anime," said Sakurai. For instance, he said there is a bookstore near Lac Leman in Geneva that has about 11,000 Japanese comic books.
"You don't see a lot of bookstores with 11,000 comics, even in Japan," he said.
He recounts his world lecture tour on anime in his book "Anime Bunka Gaiko" ("Anime Culture Diplomacy"), in which he writes how surprised he was in Saudi Arabia to find a strong turnout and a passion for anime among the people in the very conservative Muslim country. <a href="Anime.html#4">[4]</a><br/><br/>

"Cartoon Network's late night Adult Segment, which heavily features Japanese anime is now the most watched cable block in its time slot for men between 18-34, beating out Jon Stewart Daily Show, the Tonight Show, and the Late Show with David Letterman"<a href="Anime.html#5">[5]</a><br/><br/>

"Pokemon...generated $2.3 trillion in worldwide sales"<a href="Anime.html#6">[6]</a><br/><br/>

 "Japan...world's largest exporter of animation"<a href="Anime.html#7">[7]</a><br/><br/>

"It is estimated that Japanese animation industry accounts for ten percent of Japan's GDP"<a href="Anime.html#7">[7]</a><br/><br/>

 "In August 1996, the Journal of American Billboard Ranking announced that No.1 selling video in America was...Ghost in the shell"<a href="Anime.html#8">[8]</a>br/><br/>

Akihabara(Tokyo) and Nippon bashi(Osaka) are popular destinations for Anime fansbr/><br/>
