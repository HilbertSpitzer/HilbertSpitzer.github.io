"What’s in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet"</br></br>

In Act-II, Scene-II of Shakespeare’s play, Romeo and Juliet. Juliet says this phrase in implying that family names have nothing to do with love and that they should be together regardless of what others think, why should their love be forbidden merely due to their family names?</br></br>

The Ancients Egyptians believed that words had a magical effect on the world. When the heretic Pharoah Akhenaten initiated his revolution, he was punished by having mentions of his name systematically eliminated. The Roman punishment of "Damnatio memoriae" was considered to be worse than death, for it would literally erase you from Roman history</br></br>

Today the Japanese tradiional religion still retains the belief that words have a magical effect on the world in a concept called Kotodama, it can be translated as "the soul of a word/s" but it can also mean "the power of word/s". Considering the number of people who keep constantly changing the English language and who keep telling us what were allowed and not allowed to say and think, one really has to wonder just what kind of power do words really have over people</br></br>

Just like religion, language is a cultural phenomenon, it is therefore unsurprising that they are often tied together and compliment each other.</br></br>
Spanish, Filipino, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Greek, Armenian, or Igbo (amongst others) native speakers in the world tend to be Christian</br></br>
Persian, Arabic, Azeri, Somali, Turkish, Maldivian, Acehnese, Uzbek, Turkmen, Malay, or Javanese (amongst others) native speakers in the world tend to be Muslim</br></br>
Khmer, Thai, Burmese, Sinhala (amongst others) native speakers in the world tend to be Buddhist</br></br>
Balinese, Hindi, Nepalese, Tamil (amongst others) native speakers in the world tend to be Hindu</br></br>
Fon, Ewe, Gen, Kabiye (amongst others) native speakers in the world tend to belong to the Vodoun religion</br></br>
And believe me there's more. But not to stretch too much the point upon it, your language can tell you much about your culture, the word "Thunder" in Norwegian means "Thor's roar", it is therefore easy to imagine what the Vikings thought of a Thunder meant. In hebrew, the word for human literally means "the son of Adam", incidentally, Adam is also a shortened version of the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&strongs=h127" target=_blank>hebrew word for ground</a>, perhaps he was named Adam as a reminder that he was created from the dust of the ground in the Book of Genesis. It could be thath the word Adam is ultimately derived from the Hebrew word for "red" or "to be red", referring to the ruddy colour of human skin, or from Akkadian adamu meaning "to make".

I feel that the Japanese language is unique in many ways, for example, it's a very description heavy language where one word in Japanese can be used to describe something that would take a whole sentence in other languages to describe, for example, "Komorebi" means "Sunlight filtering through the trees". This emphasis on nature shows in the way they keep naming things after something related to nature, calling a person "Summer"(Natsu) or "Midsummer"(Manatsu) or "Summer Eye"(Natsume) or "Summer Rainbow"(Kako) would be odd in English. This emphasis on nature also shows in their native religion, Shintoism</br></br>

Another thing is the Japanese word "nakanaori", which is the word for making peace with someone, but it can also mean self(naka) + recovery(naori). So making peace with others is synonymous with making peace with oneself, as if in order to make up with another person you first have to have peace from within, this was probably influenced by Chinese Taoism&Confucianism about how in order for there to be <a href="http://www.worldprayers.org/archive/prayers/meditations/if_there_is_to_be_peace.html" target=_blank>world peace</a> there first <a href="http://www.worldprayers.org/archive/prayers/meditations/to_put_the_world_right.html" target=_blank>has to be peace from within</a>, and indeed Shinto text does show Chinese influence, infact Shinto itself is a Chinese word and not a Japanese one
