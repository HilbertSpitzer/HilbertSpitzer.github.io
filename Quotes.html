<BODY> 
<font color="blue">"Japan's very interesting. Some people think it copies things. I don't think that anymore. I think what they do is reinvent things. They will get something that's already been invented and study it until they thoroughly understand it. In some cases, they understand it better than the original inventor." </font><br/>
<big>Steve Jobs(co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Apple Inc.)</big><br/><br/>

<font color="green">"Clearly, Japan is a most important market for digital consumer products." </font><br/>
<big>David Milne </big><br/><br/>

<font color="brown">"If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan."</font><br/>
<big>Alan Perlis (an American computer scientist known for his pioneering work in programming languages and the first recipient of the Turing Award.)</big><br/><br/>

<font color="violet">"You can find academic and industrial groups doing some relevant work, but there isn't a focus on building complex molecular systems. In that respect, Japan is first, Europe is second, and we're third."</font><br/>
<big>K. Eric Drexler(American engineer best known for popularizing the potential of molecular nanotechnology)</big><br/><br/>

<font color="grey">"As far as technology, I’d go to Japan. Not everything should be centred around the U.S. All the special effects from these… countries were awesome."</font><br/>
<big>Michelle Rodriguez</big><br/><br/>

<font color="pink">"Japan always seems to be the land of opportunity."</font><br/>
<big>Jason Rogers</big><br/><br/>

<font color="orange">"Japan is a fast adopter of new ideas. If you're hot in Japan, you're hot really fast."</font><br/>
