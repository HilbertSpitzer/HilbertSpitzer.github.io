In 1274 and again in 1281 the continental Mongol forces, who had already conquered most of China and all of Korea, attempted to invade Japan. Led by the courageous young regent Hojo Tokimune, the Japanese put up a fierce defense. The Mongol forces were technologically superior, however, employing complex coordinated troop movements of large infantry and cavalry units, whereas the Japanese were more accustomed to fighting as individual samurai. The Mongols also used powerful cross-bows and catapults that fired exploding fireballs. The Japanese still used swords, spears, and longbows. The Mongols were also a numerically superior force. In the 1274 attempted invasion they brought nearly 30,000 Mongol and Korean warriors, in 1281 a huge armada with a combined (PAGE 31) Chinese, Mongol, and Korean force of nearly 140,000 men. The Japanese put up a determined fight, but ultimately the Mongols were driven away by typhoons both times (which the Japanese called kamikaze or ‘‘Wind of the Gods’’) off the northwestern coast of Kyushu.<a href="Otherfacts.html#10">[10]</a><br/><br/>
