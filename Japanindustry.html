<b><font color="red">Before considering Japan's industrial and economic achievements consider the following:</font>
<br/><br/>

Japan is an Isolated island country, having no natural resources except negligible mineral resources and fish<a href="JapanIndustry.html#0">[0]</a><a name="[0]"></a>, 10% of all active volcanoes are in Japan, and 20% of earthquakes magnitude 6 or greater occur in Japan. It is therefore no surprise that the 2 costliest natural disasters have also occured in Japan(1995 Kobe Earthquake and 2011 Tohoku Earthquake)
<br/><br/>

It's difficult to urbanize Japan due to its mountainous terrain. Only two countries are less urbanized than Japan(and even then it's not by much) and yet have a larger GDP per capita(and even then it's not by much). Because only 20 percent of Japan’s total land is suitable for agriculture, residence, and industry, nearly four hundred people live on each square kilometer of that space. Another way of thinking about it is that the total population of Japan lives in an area smaller than either tiny Portugal or Scotland. Japan’s total living space could fit into Hokkaido, only one of its over one thousand islands! The rest of Japan is too mountainous for many people to inhabit. <a href="JapanIndustry.html#1">[1]</a><a name="[1]"></a>
<br/><br/>

These might all seem like moot points, but think about this carefully. Japan has to deal with all of these problems all together at once. Japan is a large country, so it can't depend on things like oil to make it a rich country like Qatar does, and it can't depend on tourism either to support its population, even if you can find a developed country with just one of those disadvantages, you have to take into account that Japan deals with a lot more than just one problem, Switzerland and Singapore both have negligible natural resources much like Japan, but along with that fact also comes the fact that Japan is fairly isolated, something that can't be claimed for either country infact; Singapore became a transport hub at least partly thanks to Japan in the first place. Since Japan has virtually no natural resources it has to compensate this by importing resources from other countries, this costs money. And that aside from the fact that it's an isolated country, which means it also has to overcome transportation costs. Just from this one example it's easy to see that the rest of the developed world does not experience disadvantages of such a high degree.
<br/><br/>

"Japan must import fully 97 percent of the natural resources and raw materials used in its industry"<a href="JapanIndustry.html#25">[25]</a>
<br/><br/><a name="[25]"></a>

"Island countries, if they are to progress, must overcome the challenge of being isolated from other lands, peoples, ideas, and economies. To solve this problem, the Japanese have developed one of the world's best networks of sea and air linkages"<a href="JapanIndustry.html#26">[26]</a><a name="[26]"></a>
<br/><br/>

"To reduce transportation costs, Japanese industry has specialized in high value/low bulk manufactured goods. Cameras, watches, small tools, and other high value manufactured goods weigh very little, hence, cost little to ship - regardless of the distance....The per unit cost of shipping a new car from Japan to the western coast of the United States, for example, is less than trucking the vehicle from Los Angeles to a dealership in Phoenix, Arizona."<a href="JapanIndustry.html#25">[25]</a><a name="[25.1]"></a>
<br/><br/>

More recently, Japan started facing new challenges such as having +27% of its population at 65 years old or above, which is the most elderly population of any country. It's needless to say that taking care of an aging shrinking population is an extremely difficult task<br/><br/>

Japan also has to deal with being an isolated island nation. Japan's islands are scattered over a huge area measuring roughly 3,000 miles(4800 kilometers). To the South, the island country of Indonesia offers an example of the consequences of not being able to deal with a scattered physical geography. Indonesia has nearly 600 different languages, a weak government, and suffers from a long history of internal conflicts. And yet in spite of its scattered physical geography, Japan is one of the world's most cohesive countries. The Japanese share a strong common heritage and sense of nationalism. Few countries in the world can match Japan's strong social, cultural, and racial cohesion, or sense of national unity. This means that nearly all Japanese people are willing to work and sacrifice for their country and for the well-being of their fellow countrymen.<a href="JapanIndustry.html#2">[2]</a><a name="[2]"></a></b><br/><br/>

<big><b>Now on to the achievements:</big></b><br/><br/>

In the aftermath of World War 2, postwar inflation resulted in a total augmentation of 15000% from 1945 through 1949 with the U.S imposing three harsh measures on Japan: a balanced budget, the suspending of all state loans to industry, and the abolition of all state subsidies.<a href="JapanIndustry.html#4">[4]</a><a name="[4]"></a> Overseas trade was also restricted and many of Japan's largest companies were closed by the occupation forces. Japan however was capable of overcoming this, and in what is now dubbed to be the Izanagi Boom, it managed by 1970 to become the third largest economy only behind the U.S and the USSR(both of which had more than double of Japan's population)<a href="JapanIndustry.html#5">[5]</a><a name="[5]"></a>. And by 1986 Japan's GDP was surpassed that of the USSR. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large as the rest of Asia combined. And in 1995 Japan even managed to tie with the U.S for a single day<a href="JapanIndustry.html#24">[24]</a><a name="[24]"></a>. Of course, truly surpassing the U.S for good still proved to be too difficult for Japan. But Japan still has the third largest GDP in the world(behind China and the U.S). So whenever any country insists that it's too tough to industrialize, remember Japan
<br/><br/>

Developments  of the Industrial Revolution which had taken over two hundred years in the West occured in a mere decade in Japan<a href="JapanIndustry.html#3">[3]</a><a name="[3]"></a>
<br/><br/>

By 1981-2008 Japan was the largest producer of motor vehicles. In 1982 70% of all computers were made in Japan. In 1983 Japan produced nearly 30% of all motor vehicles in the world<a href="JapanIndustry.html#6">[6]</a><a name="[6]"></a>
<br/><br/>

Japan is the world's largest electronics manufacturer<a href="JapanIndustry.html#9">[9]</a><a name="[9]"></a>
<br/><br/>

In 1989 the Market capitalization of Japanese companies represented 42% of all stocks in the world, in December of 1989 Japanese stocks accounted for over half the value of the world's stock markets<a href="JapanIndustry.html#28">[28]</a><a name="[28]"></a>. And in 1990, the Tokyo Stock Exchange accounted for 60 percent of the world stock market value<a href="JapanIndustry.html#27">[27]</a><a name="[27]"></a>
<br/><br/>

This explosion of Japanese urbanization created perhaps the world’s most urbanized country by 1700. Perhaps 10–12 percent of the population was urban, about half of that number was samurai<a href="JapanIndustry.html#7">[7]</a><a name="[7]"></a>
<br/><br/>

The U.N ranked Japan as the most developed country the third most times(After Norway and Canada), it ranked it as the most developed country in 1990, 1991, and 1993
<br/><br/>

Herman Kahn in 1970 predicted that Japan would surpass the U.S as the leading economic power, he thought it would do that in 2000. Eamonn Fingleton in the year 1995 also thought that Japan would surpass the U.S. Time magazine even published a book called ""Times" Guide to Japan: Understanding the World's Newest Superpower" in which it said that "With an economy poised to overtake America's as the world's largest, Japan's is the undisputed success story of the late-20th century". During the years 1993-95, Japan had a GDP larger than the 3 largest European Country and Japan's GDP was 71% the size of the U.S according to the U.N. Measured by current exchange rates Japan surpassed the U.S in 1993 to become the world's largest manufacturing economy, and Japan jumped from the 6th to 2nd per capita income between 1989 and 1993<a href="JapanIndustry.html#8">[8]</a><a name="[8]"></a>
<br/><br/>

According to the WorldBank, in 2010 Japan's GDP was so large that it was, <font color="blue"> larger than Latin America&Caribbean,</font><font color="violet"> <u>or</u> larger than all the Arab World, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia combined,</font><font color="green"> <u>or</u> larger than all of the Muslim World,</font><font color="brown"> <u>or</u> larger than all of the Hindu world by 3 times</font>

According to the economist: "A new study from the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company, makes some judgments about what governments should and should not be doing. While broadband rankings typically measure factors such as the speed, availability and retail prices of existing services, a measure created for the study, the government broadband index (gBBi), looks instead at the components of the highest-profile public-sector plans. Besides targets for speed and population coverage, these include the cost to the taxpayer as a percentage of annual government revenues and the deadlines for universal access. The gBBi also considers the regulatory aspects of the various plans. Here are the results:....South Korea tops the index with a score of 4.4 out of 5, with Japan in second place and Singapore in third"<a href="JapanIndustry.html#16">[16]</a><a name="[16]"></a>
